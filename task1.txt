01. Describe the main diferences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and CSS Grid layout model. When you would choose to one over other?
Ans:

Dimensionality:

Flexbox is one-dimensional, suitable for arranging items in a single row or column.
Grid is two-dimensional, allowing for precise control over rows and columns.

Alignment:
Flexbox excels at aligning items along a single axis.
Grid offers alignment in both rows and columns, making it ideal for complex layouts.

Item Order:
Flexbox is great for reordering items within a single axis.
Grid offers more versatile item reordering in both rows and columns.

Spacing:
Flexbox focuses on distributing space along one axis.
Grid provides control over spacing in both row and column dimensions.

Use Cases:
Choose Flexbox for simple, linear layouts like navigation menus and centered elements.
Opt for Grid in complex, grid-based designs, such as magazine layouts or forms that require precise column placement and alignment
